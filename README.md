# StarWarz

Deployed to render: https://starwarz.onrender.com

StarWarz is a frontend app that allows you to view, edit, and delete all the Star Wars data you've ever wanted, including planets, spaceships, vehicles, people, films, and species.

I used Vue3, Vuex, and Vuetify for styling. StarWarz also features a caching mechanism for the data provided by https://swapi.dev.

This was my first time using Vuetify, and I learned a lot from the experience. Thank you for the opportunity.
